This a quiz app made using react and react libraries. The questions and answers are stored in the data folder and is fetched using a custom API.
To use this, first open the project and in the command prompt, write "npm run server", this will run the data on port 8000
Next you may open another terminal and write "npm start" to start the project

I have added a walkthrough of this app
